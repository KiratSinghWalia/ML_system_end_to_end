End-to-End Production ML Pipeline with Metaflow 🚀

This repository contains an end-to-end, production-ready Machine Learning project built using Metaflow.
The pipeline covers the complete ML lifecycle — from data ingestion to model training, evaluation, deployment, and monitoring — with unit testing and AWS deployment support.

While the default implementation uses the Penguin dataset, the architecture is dataset-agnostic and can be easily extended to other datasets and ML problems.
